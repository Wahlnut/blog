	<p id = "week_ten">This is the beggining of my journey of backpacking. It started with meeting a good friend of mine, Charlie, who has traveled to well over 60 countires and has learned many tricks to expereincing a country for very cheap. Everyone of these trips I went on was at least 10 days and full price including flights was less than 1,500 dollars. Many of the countries were in either a level 3 or 4 advisory when I visited, leading to a neccessary learning of how to carry myself and being aware of my surrondings. Luckily during these trips I was travelling with a few other people making us less of a target. In Jamacia there were a few unerving moment. Understanding these risks and the political environment you are traveling to is very important to planning a safe and fun trip! Throughout this website I will be sharing some my experiences with navagating these risks and other tips reagrding saving money.</p>

		<p>This was my first time travelling to a less devolped country and I learned a lot fast. Withing nearly 30 minuetes of arriving I left my group in a van with to native Jamacians to go purchase some specific parishable, one of the most naive choices I've made leaving my friends confused and worried. Luckily it worked out and these men ended up giving us a ride to our hostel for free because of the purchase I made, but it could've gone south fast if they were bad people. Anoter lesson I learned this day was about barganing, many countries with less inffluenteal currency look at American travelers a checkbook. At the time I had long hair and decided to get it braided the local quoted me 15 USD and after they were done attempted to charge me 80$, leading to me having to talk them down and them being very stubborn. I ended up paying 50$ and feeling scammed, many of these individuals are very aggressive with their tactics getting in your face or giving you an item saying its free then forcing you to pay after accepting. Many products are often not authentic and will be marketed as such. </p>
